Here is where we will keep all the content for the Astro Hack 
Week 2014 blog.

See the [PLAN](PLAN.md), for the list of all bloggable hacks, in 
order of who's blogging next. Feel free to add yours if you 
don't see it!

Guidelines for Hackers are in the [main README](https://github.com/AstroHackWeek/website_source/blob/master/README.md) of this repo.

Have fun!
